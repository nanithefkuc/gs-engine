## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Replaced aggregate benchmark binaries with Criterion stage and end-to-end
  groups, explicit strategy comparisons, allocation/retained-memory reporting,
  reproducibility metadata, frozen GF8/GF16 candidate fixtures, and external
  decoder source pins.
- Moved shifted weak-Popov row reduction to `gfm::weak_popov`, retaining the
existing polynomial representation, deterministic leading-term order, and
interpolation results.
- Replaced the former `fff` dependency with `fgf` and updated `cafft` to the
shared field types and dispatch backend.
